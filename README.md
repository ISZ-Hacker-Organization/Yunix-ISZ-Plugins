WARNING!!! A very good C++ coder has made a program to examine his plugin, we can see that the plugin has access to your 3DS files directly and can therefore delete them, he also accesses a file that must not be deleted at risk that your 3DS breaks

English translation : Probably DS settings
Already it is in the memory of the DS
So a pillar thing that should not be deleted
Hey Yunix
You wouldn't try to delete it by chance
It's crazy all the same that right next to the "Access denied!", it finds paths to very important files on your DS
